Edit object parameters

Recalls the "add mesh" object operator.

Generic functions to re-create an object that was created
with a "Add Mesh" operator.

The "Add Mesh" operator has to store the "recall" information
in the object properties for this to work.

Usage:

Select an "recall enabled" object and click the "Edit" button
in the "Edit Object Parameters" panel of the Tool Shelf.

Known issues:

The recall doesn't take the rotation/scaling of the
exiting object into account.
i.e. The new object will be created as if it's created
manually at the location of the exiting object.
This also means that "align to view" may affect
rotation of the new object.

v0.1.2 - Changed the name of the operator(s) ('Edit object parameters')
     Added warning about mesh-deletion.
v0.1.1 - Removed changes to 3D cursor.
    Removed removal of objects (Has to be handled in "Add Mesh" operator now.)
v0.1 - Initial revision
